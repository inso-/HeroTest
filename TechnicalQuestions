1. I spend between 1h30 and 2h30 hours on the test, I had no more available time to do it.

2. A list of all the thing I will have made to improve the quality of this test if I had more time to work on it.
This list is non exhaustive, there is so much thing that we can improve if we had an unlimited number of time

On app:

Functional:
- I will have make a more styled page for the user interface by having a more beautiful sort functionality with a drop down menu.
- Display more information for each item (for example: brand, picture)
- Display the total number of items displayed
- Add a loader on collectionViewFooter when the app is « loading more »
- Add an Error displaying when the network is bad
- Add a title on Navigation Bar
- Add a details view for product displaying more information by calling the details API 

- Add a splashScreen
- Add an AppIcon

Technical:

Model:
- I will have made the filter function more independent from Domain by making a model Item independent from the one in domain and by making a converter between this model and the one in Domain subtarget
- I will have made a ItemCellModel independent from Domain by having only the needed information inside and not the Item object model from Domain

Dependency Injection improvement:
- I will have made ItemsListViewController more independent by taking an object conforming to itemsUseCase

Unit Test:
- I will have make unit test not only for presenter and interaction but also for ItemsListViewController and and ItemsListWorker
